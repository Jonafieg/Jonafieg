- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jonafieg A.K.A Charlotte Stone
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack development though I think I may have a preference for the back-end so I'll be exploring that as I progress on my developer journey.
- Outside of programming I enjoy learning languages (I also speak Japanese, French and a fair bit of Spanish), playing video games, and generally unplugging & getting away from screens.
- Perhaps I've watched too much Japanese animation, but one day I would love to work with mechatronics.
- 🌱 I’m currently focussing my learning React as I wasn't completely happy with what I took away from my finishing the frontend developer course at Scrimba.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that aim have a positive social and environmental affect on the world.
- 📫 How to reach me:
-     E-mail: charlie.stone649@gmail.com
