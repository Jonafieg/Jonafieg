- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jonafieg A.K.A Charlotte Stone
- 👀 I’m interested in frontend development when it comes to a career, however I'm interested in all assets of programming so I sometimes fall down rabbit holes and learn adjacent information that I then try to roll into my process.
- Outside of programming I enjoy learning languages (I also speak Japanese, French and a fair bit of Spanish), playing video games, walking through forests as well as many other things.
- 🌱 I’m currently focussing my learning on problem solving and algorithms to make myself better at programming overall. I'm taking a small break from learning React while I go through Codecademy's Computer Science career path.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that aim have a positive social and environmental affect on the world.
